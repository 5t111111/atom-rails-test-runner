# rails-test-runner package

To run Rails 5 test runner (`rails test`) without leaving Atom.

HotKeys:

- __Ctrl+Alt+T__ - executes all tests in the current file
- __Ctrl+Alt+X__ - executes only the test on the line the cursor's at

## For rbenv users

When using rbenv, you have to load rbenv configuration in your `.bash_profile`
since rails-test-runner launchs bash shell for running a test runner.

## TODO

- [ ] Write tests!
- [ ] Output content should be escaped
